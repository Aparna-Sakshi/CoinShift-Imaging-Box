### Intro:

Face blurring is a computer vision method used to anonymize faces in images and video. Here, Deep Learning based Face Detector is used to detect the face we need to blur. **OneAPI** will be incorporated to make using the code easier in every machine. 

### Methodology:
The process of face blurring process.
- The first step is to perform face detection. In this case, I have used to Deep Learning Face Detection of OpenCV.
- After the face is detected, the ROI is extracted.
- Then various blurring techniques like Gaussian Blur and Pixelated Blur are applied. 
- The last step involves adding the blurred face to the original image.

### Technologies Used:
- OpenCV
- Python 3
- OneAPI
