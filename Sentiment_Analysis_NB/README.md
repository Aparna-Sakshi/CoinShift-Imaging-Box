# Sentiment Analysis Using Naive Bayes Algorithm

Here, Bernoulli Bayes is deployed for analysis, as it works better than any other algorithm.

# Steps to follow :

 ## 1. Text Preprocessing
  1. Removal of HTML tags. ( Due to inefficient web scraping of the data )
  2. Removal of Stopwords which have no contribution in the analysis ( a, and, the, or, many, which,...)
  3. Removal of the Special characters. For our usecase (differentiating the sentiment between positive and negative), special characters aren't required

 ## 2.  Vectorization of Data

 ## 3. Apply appropriate ML algorithm

 ## 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

 ## 5. Building deployment ready pipelines
