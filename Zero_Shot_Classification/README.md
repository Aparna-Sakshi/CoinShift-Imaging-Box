# Zero Shot Classification

This is a text classification model trained on Natural Language Interface ( NLI). Text classification is the process of categorizing the text into a set of words.

In zero-shot classification, you can define your own labels and then run classifier to assign a probability to each label. You can have a query and the classifier will predict the probability to each labels that how much that query is related to a particular label.
