Open source software is software that is freely available to the public. This means that anyone can download it and use it for any purpose they want. It does not mean that the software has to be free of charge, but that it can be freely used by anyone. In other words, if you want to use a piece of software, you don't have to pay for it, and you can do whatever you like with it as long as you are not infringing on anyone else's rights. The term "open source" is often used to refer to software which is free for anyone to download, use and modify.
